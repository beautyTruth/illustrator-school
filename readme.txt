Hello and happy whatever day it happens to be. This directory and accompanying repo contains project files and knickknacks related to my summer 2022 attempt to learn Adobe Illustrator. It's kind of a hodgepodge of myriad knickknacks. One might call it a menagerie. If you were Tennessee Williams, you might call it a dead salesman.

I have a lot of experience with Illustrator, having used it professionally for years whilst I was a sailor in the world's finest navy, the United States Navy. This is an attempt to learn the program semi-formally through purchased Udemy courses.

Below will be a running documentation of the things I've learned in each lesson. I'll avoid uploading each of the exercise files due to size and personal ennui.

1. I learned how to reset the workspace and how to create multiple artboards in a single document.  I didn't know how to do either of those basic things despite having used this program for literally decades. I also learned how to change presets for a document's units of measurement. Again, that was something I was completely ignorant of.
