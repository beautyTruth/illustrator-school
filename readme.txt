Hello and happy whatever day it happens to be. This directory and accompanying repo contains project files and knickknacks related to my summer 2022 attempt to learn Adobe Illustrator. It's kind of a hodgepodge of myriad knickknacks. One might call it a menagerie. If you were Tennessee Williams, you might call it a dead salesman.

I have a lot of experience with Illustrator, having used it professionally for years whilst I was a sailor in the world's finest navy, the United States Navy. This is an attempt to learn the program semi-formally through purchased Udemy courses.
